## Introduction

Several years ago, my journey into the world of programming began with a simple desire; to create a Discord bot. Little did I know that this decision would open the doors to a world of endless possibilities and opportunities for learning. With JavaScript as my starting point, I embarked on a journey filled with challenges, triumphs, and ultimately, the discovery of a programming language that would become my go-to tool in the realm of software development; TypeScript.

This post will be a collection of my experience based on how I discover my first programming language and how I embrace it as my journey continues.

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

## How I discovered JavaScript?

My journey into programming was driven by the need to develop a Discord bot. Armed with determination and curiosity, I delved into the vast realm of programming languages and stumbled upon JavaScript. Its versatility and popularity made it an ideal choice for a beginner like me. With the help of online resources and documentation, I began to unravel the intricacies of JavaScript and its application in building interactive and dynamic web applications.

## Introduction to TypeScript

After a year of honing my skills and learning from other senior programmers using JavaScript, I encountered whispers of a language touted for its enhanced features and benefits; TypeScript. Intrigued by the prospect of a more robust and type-safe alternative to JavaScript, I decided to explore this new territory. Transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript was akin to upgrading from a bicycle to a sports car. The static typing, intelligent autocompletion, and comprehensive tooling offered by TypeScript revolutionized my approach to programming.

## Embracing TypeScript

As I delved deeper into TypeScript, I realized its potential to streamline my development process and enhance the quality of my code. Whether working on personal projects, small applications, or large-scale endeavors, TypeScript proved to be a reliable companion, empowering me to write cleaner, more maintainable code with confidence. Its strict syntactical rules and compile-time checks served as invaluable safeguards against common pitfalls and errors, ultimately saving time and effort in the long run.

## Continuing with TypeScript

Today, TypeScript has become an indispensable part of my toolkit as a software developer. Its versatility, scalability, and community support make it the perfect choice for tackling a diverse range of projects. From crafting elegant web applications to developing robust backend systems, TypeScript continues to fuel my passion for innovation and creativity in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

## Conclusion

My journey into programming began with a simple Discord bot and evolved into a profound exploration of languages, tools, and methodologies. Through perseverance and curiosity, I discovered the transformative power of TypeScript and embraced it as my primary programming language of choice. As I look back on my journey, I am grateful for the experiences and lessons learned along the way, and I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible with TypeScript by my side.
