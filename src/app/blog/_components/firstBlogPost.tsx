			<p>
				Several years ago, my journey into the world of programming began with a simple desire; is to create a Discord
				bot. Little did I know that this decision would open the doors to a world of endless possibilities and
				opportunities for my learning. With JavaScript as my starting point, I embarked on a journey filled with
				challenges, triumphs, and ultimately, the discovery of a language that would become my go-to tool in the realm
				of software development; TypeScript.

			</div>
			<p>
				My foray programming language was driven by the need to develop a Discord bot. Armed with determination and
				curiosity, I delivered into the vast realm of programming languages and stumbled upon JavaScript. It&apos;s
				versatility and popularity made it an ideal choice for a beginner like me. With the help of online resources and
				documentation, I began to unravel the intricacies of JavaScript and it&apos;s application in building
				interactive and dynamic web applications.

			<p>
				After a year of honing my skills with JavaScript, I encountered whispers of a language touted for it&apos;s
				enhanced features and benefits; TypeScript. Intrigued by the prospect of a more robust and type-safe alternative
				to JavaScript, I decided to explore a new territory. Transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript was akin to
				upgrading from a bicycle to a sports car. The static typing, intelligent autocompletion, and comprehensive
				tooling offered by TypeScript really revolutionized my approach to programming.
